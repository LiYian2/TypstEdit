# TypstEdit

A native macOS editor for Typst, with Chinese and English UI, source editing and PDF preview.

## Build and run

Requires **macOS 13+** and **Swift 6.1+** (Command Line Tools or Xcode). No package dependencies need downloading.

```bash
swift build
./bundle.sh
open .build/TypstEdit.app
```

`bundle.sh` produces an optimized Release app for the current architecture and bundles the matching Typst executable. The generated app is ad-hoc signed for local use. The original tracked `TypstEdit.app` in this repository is an older prebuilt artifact; use `.build/TypstEdit.app` to run these changes.

For ARM64 + Intel:

```bash
./bundle_universal.sh
./create_dmg.sh
```

Generated apps and installers go in `.build/`. Build scripts accept Swift build options, for example `./bundle.sh --scratch-path /tmp/typstedit-build`.

## Compiler selection / 选择 Typst 版本

Open **TypstEdit → Settings…** (`⌘,`). Choose:

- **Automatic / 自动检测**: searches the inherited PATH and common Homebrew/Cargo locations first, then falls back to the bundled compiler.
- **Bundled / 内置版本**: uses the app's compiler (currently **0.12.0**).
- **Custom / 自选可执行文件**: select an executable or enter its absolute path; `~` and paths with spaces are supported. An invalid custom choice reports an error instead of silently using another version.

Settings display the selected path and the actual `typst --version` result. No compiler is downloaded automatically.

## Imports / 跨文件夹引用

The opened project folder is passed to Typst as `--root`. You can select another project root in Settings. The root must contain the current source file and any imported files.

```text
project/
  chapters/main.typ
  shared/style.typ
```

Open `project`, then either of these works inside `chapters/main.typ`:

```typst
#import "../shared/style.typ": *
#import "/shared/style.typ": *
```

Relative paths resolve beside each source file. Typst's `/shared/style.typ` is **project-root-relative**. It is not ordinarily the macOS filesystem path. For imports across folders, choose their common parent as the root. An explicit `/` root permits filesystem-absolute imports, but a smaller common project root is usually easier to keep portable. See [Typst path documentation](https://typst.app/docs/reference/syntax/).

Live preview uses a unique temporary `.typ` sibling so it can compile unsaved edits while preserving relative imports. The source directory must be writable. Preview PDFs live in the temporary directory and normal close/switch operations remove preview artifacts.

## Save, export and share

- **Open / 打开**: `⌘O`.
- **Save source / 保存源文件**: `⌘S`.
- **Export PDF / 导出 PDF**: `⇧⌘E`, or the export toolbar button. Select a destination; the editor compiles the captured current text, including unsaved changes. Compilation failure preserves an existing destination PDF.
- **Refresh Preview / 刷新预览**: `⇧⌘R`.
- Print uses the current successful preview. Sharing uses the last explicitly exported PDF.

Open files share a window with a horizontal tab bar. Click a sidebar file or use **Open** (multiple selection supported) to add a tab. Switching tabs retains each draft, selection and undo history; only the active tab has a preview compiler. An orange dot marks unsaved changes. Closing a modified tab, changing project folders, closing the window or quitting prompts to Save, Cancel or Discard. Opening a new project folder closes the current tabs after these checks.

Each tab retains the project root selected when it was first opened. Reopening the same file, including through a symlink, selects its existing tab. For a different root, close and reopen the tab under that project, or set an explicit root in Settings. Imports read other files from disk, so save edits to imported tabs before compiling the main file.

Preview updates no longer overwrite a final PDF automatically. Compilation errors leave the editor editable, including Chinese IME input. Chinese/English UI follows the first macOS preferred language. The bilingual template uses `PingFang SC` with a Latin font fallback; PDF fonts/language remain under control of the Typst document.

## Git, Preview and Auto Save

- Git repositories show colored file badges, a branch/change list, and green/blue/red gutter marks for added/modified/deleted lines. Gutter comparisons include the current unsaved draft and staged changes relative to HEAD. The change list shows index/worktree status in two columns and can open changed `.typ` files; renames show both paths. Git is read-only here.
- The **right sidebar button / 右侧预览按钮** hides or restores Preview. Hiding it expands the editor, cancels compilation, and releases the preview PDF/compiler; saving and PDF export still work. The choice persists.
- Enable **Settings → Editing → Auto Save / 设置 → 编辑 → 自动保存** to save after one second without typing. It defaults to off. Each tab saves independently, including after compilation errors; provisional IME input is excluded. Closing prompts suspend pending saves, and cancelling resumes them.
- If the disk file differs from the last saved version, saving pauses and retains the draft. Use **Save a Copy / 保存副本** to preserve it before reviewing the external version. No automatic retry loop or repeated alert.

Git runs serially in the background, refreshes after a short typing debounce and every four seconds, and caches unchanged line diffs. Each command has a three-second timeout; obsolete results are discarded. No Git process stays resident. Homebrew Git or Apple's developer-tools Git is required; missing Git disables decorations without starting an installer. Ordinary folders require no Git installation. The change list displays up to 200 entries.

## Performance and memory

The app and bundled CLI run natively on Apple Silicon. Typst uses its default available-CPU parallelism; the editor keeps one watcher for the active tab to retain incremental caches and observe imports. Typst compilation in this integration has no GPU or Neural Engine backend.

Syntax regexes are cached and evaluated serially off the main thread after a short debounce, with cancellation of obsolete work. Line offsets update around UTF-16 edits instead of rescanning the source. Only the current visible syntax colors and line labels are retained; the gutter belongs to the editor's native scroll view. PDF reload requests are coalesced and snapshots read in the background; PDFKit installation preserves position and zoom.

**Lower idle memory / 降低空闲内存占用** in Settings switches to a compiler process that exits after each edit-triggered compilation. This releases the compiler's cache while idle, at the cost of slower repeated builds. Imported files edited externally need **Refresh Preview** in this mode. The default incremental mode watches them automatically.

**Font discovery / 字体扫描** under Performance lets you add font folders (one absolute path per line) and optionally stop scanning system fonts. This can shorten cold compiler startup. Keep all fonts needed by your document available, including Chinese and emoji; embedded Typst fonts remain enabled. The default keeps system fonts. Replacement preview processes wait for old processes to exit, reducing overlapping caches.

Line-offset suffix shifts still scale with line count, PDF snapshots still take memory, and sustained profiling is needed. See [DIAGNOSTICS.md](DIAGNOSTICS.md) for measured results and limits.

## Regression checks

```bash
./test.sh
./benchmark.sh  # optional: repeatable line-index and tokenization A/B benchmarks
```

The native regression runner uses `swiftc`, AppKit and PDFKit, so it works with Command Line Tools without XCTest or full Xcode. It covers executable resolution, streamed diagnostics, UTF-16 positions, logical line offsets, Chinese IME composition, real imports and PDF export, compiler failure recovery, process/artifact cleanup, low-memory compilation, 3,000 randomized native storage edits, obsolete-task cancellation, PDF coalescing/retry, font configuration, rapid preview requests, tab draft/save failure handling, independent undo, editor release, and diagnostics before native input callbacks. macOS filesystem watcher tests need native file-event services; restrictive shell sandboxes may suppress these events.
